# WPA2Hasher
A program for creating WPA/WPA2 Pre-shared keys (hashes).

**How to use:**
1. Run `java -jar wpa2h.jar <ssid> <password>`.
2. Wait about a second.
3. The PSK/Hash has been generated.

**Is is safe?**

It's completely safe! All the hashing is done on YOUR machine, and no info is sent to me or a server. Inspect the code yourself for proof!
